# Wanderlust

> This game isn't a game yet. So far, you just walk.


## Game Ideas

1. You carefully pack your gear before you start.
2. You can get water from any stream you are near if you rest.
3. Hiking Trails. None exist yet. Should they?
4. The game should end when you run out of supplies and have to head back home.
5. The game should randomly generate you a starting position around the border of the map.
