# Wanderlust

> It's the journey, not the destination.

Wanderlust is, essentially, a hiking simulator. There will never be gun fights or car chases. You won't run into orcs or grizzly bears. Bandits will never jump out at you, and you won't be able to kill people to loot gold coins. This game is not meant to be face-paced or action-packed. Ideally, it will be slow-paced and contemplative.

Similarly, Wanderlust is a relaxing pursuit for the developer. The angle of the sun will accurately shade the hills you walk over; though most won't notice. Probably, no final, production-ready version of this game will ever exist.
