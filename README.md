This game is, essentially, a hiking simulator. There will never be orcs to slay or laser gun battles. It is not meant to be exciting or fast-paced. Generally, unless things are going very badly, life is slower outdoors and the game should reflect that.

Also, this game is a boutique playground for slow enjoyment on the part of the dev team as well. It is probably that no final, production-ready version of this game will ever exist.
