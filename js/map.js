/** Creata a map from a data file.
    The goal will be to make a map this is:
      accessible in pieces (without loading the whole thing at once),
      loadable from a data file (JSON or KML).
    The map should also have (or allow) for a richness of detail:
      terrain,
      ground cover,
      canopy cover,
      soil type,
      weather,
      water bodies,
      animal population
